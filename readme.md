# CrossParty

A multiplayer twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe! 🎉  
Host a server, invite your friends, and battle it out in fast-paced matches.

Lightweight, fun, and built to be easy for anyone to set up and play.

## 🚀 Installation

Make sure you’re using **Node.js v24.6** for best compatibility.  

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crossparty.git
cd crossparty
npm install
```

---

## 🎮 Client

Run the client to join a game:

```bash
npm start
```

⚠️ Make sure to edit the client’s URL to match the one the server host gives you!

---

## 🖥️ Server

Start the server with:

```bash
npm run server
```

You’ll likely need tunneling so friends outside your network can join.  
You can use **Cloudflare Tunnel**, **ngrok**, or **localtunnel**.  

Example:

```bash
npm run server
cloudflared tunnel --port 5050
```

Then share the generated link with other players.
